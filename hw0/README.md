### Summary

This Homework 0 helps you get familiar with the framework. This HW0 demonstrates
the axpy and dot kernels. 

Your job is to add the kernel implementations to the `hw0/uxxxx0/src/hw0.cpp` file and
for this homework that is all you need to do!

Run `make` and `make test` to check if your kernel is correct and if the tests
implemented in `hw0/tests/hw0.cpp` pass.
